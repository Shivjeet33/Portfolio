# How to Add a New Project to Your Portfolio

Follow these simple steps to add a new case study or project to your website.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Images
1. **Select your images:** You need at least one "Hero" image (main cover) and a few gallery images.
   - Recommended Size: 1920x1080 or 1200x800 pixels.
2. **Rename them:** Give them simple, lowercase names with hyphens.
   - Example Hero: `food-app-hero.jpg`
   - Example Gallery: `food-app-1.jpg`, `food-app-2.jpg`
3. **Move files:** Drag and drop these image files into the **`assets/`** folder of your project.

## Step 2: Add Project Data
1. Open the file named **`projectData.ts`** in your code editor.
2. Locate the `PROJECTS` constant (it's a list of project objects).
3. Copy the template below and paste it inside the list. 
   - *Tip: Paste it at the top of the list if you want it to appear first.*

```typescript
  {
    id: "unique-id-here",  // USE LOWERCASE & HYPHENS (e.g. "smart-home-app")
    title: "Project Title",
    category: "Category (e.g., UX Case Study)",
    tagline: "A short, one-sentence description for the card.",
    overview: "A detailed summary of the project.",
    role: "Your Role",
    duration: "Time taken (e.g., 2 Weeks)",
    tools: ["Figma", "Photoshop"], // List your tools here
    problem: "Description of the problem you solved.",
    solution: "Description of your design solution.",
    
    // UPDATE THESE FILENAMES TO MATCH YOUR FILES IN ASSETS FOLDER
    heroImage: "/assets/food-app-hero.jpg", 
    images: [
      "/assets/food-app-1.jpg",
      "/assets/food-app-2.jpg"
    ]
  },
```

4. **Fill in the details:** Replace the placeholder text with your actual project info.

## Step 3: Save and Publish
1. **Save** the `projectData.ts` file.
2. The website will automatically update:
   - A new card will appear on the Home page.
   - A new detailed Case Study page will be created at `/projects/unique-id-here`.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Image not showing?** Check if the filename in the code matches the file in the `assets` folder exactly (including .jpg vs .png).
- **Page not found?** Ensure your `id` is unique and contains no spaces.
